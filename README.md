# Postman API Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project uses **Postman** for automating API tests with **BDD (Cucumber)**. It supports operations like **GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE** with tools like **Newman** for running collections in the command line. It also includes **Mocking API responses** using Postman Interceptor.

## ðŸ›  Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MaksuraM/PostmanAPITesting.git
   cd PostmanAPITesting
2. **Install dependencies**  
   
sh
   npm install -g newman

## ðŸš€ Running Tests  
### Run the Collection
Run Postman tests using Newman:  
sh
   newman run AutomateTC.postman_collection.json

### Run the Collection with HTML Report
Generate an HTML report after running the tests:
sh
  newman run AutomateTC.postman_collection.json -r html

The report will be saved in a folder named newman.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
bash
